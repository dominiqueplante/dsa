# Data Structures and ALgorithms Playground

The purpose of this repository is to act a learning (and teaching) resource for various Data Structures And Algorithms problems.

The idea will be to provide developer tested solutions for these problems both using different techniques and different programming languages.  This should enable "apples to apples" comparisons to be performed.  It should also enable performance benchmarking to understand the implications of using certain techniques and/or languages in certain ways when solving problems.

Stay tuned for more!
